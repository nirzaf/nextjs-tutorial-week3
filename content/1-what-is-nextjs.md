# 1. What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that simplifies building fast, SEO-friendly, and production-ready web applications. It's built on top of React, so you get the benefits of React's component-based architecture, but it also comes with additional features that help you build full-stack applications easily.

## Key Features:

* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Renders pages on the server for improved performance and SEO
* **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time for optimal performance
* **API Routes**: Create backend API endpoints within your Next.js app
* **Fast Refresh**: Instant feedback during development
* **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**: Style your application with ease
* **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration
* **Optimized Performance**: Automatic code splitting, image optimization, and more
* **File-System Based Routing**: Simple and intuitive routing based on your file structure

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js solves many common challenges in web development:

1. **Performance**: Server-side rendering and static generation improve page load times and user experience
