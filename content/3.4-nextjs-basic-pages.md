# 3.4 Basic Page Creation & Configuration with TypeScript

---

## Learning Objectives
- Create and type your first pages in Next.js
- Understand file-based routing
- Add basic global styling
- Run and view your pages in the browser

---

## 1. Creating Your First Page

In Next.js, every file in the `pages/` directory automatically becomes a route!

### Example: Creating `index.tsx` (Homepage)
```tsx
// pages/index.tsx
import React from 'react';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to My Student Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is the homepage of your project-based portfolio app.</p>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

- Save the file. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your homepage!

---

## 2. Adding an About Page

Create a new file: `pages/about.tsx`

```tsx
// pages/about.tsx
import React from 'react';

const About: React.FC = () => (
  <main>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Write a short introduction about yourself here.</p>
  </main>
);

export default About;
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about) to see your About page.

---

## 3. Type-Safe Routing
- File names in `pages/` become routes automatically (e.g., `about.tsx` â†’ `/about`).
- Use TypeScript (`.tsx` files) for type safety and better developer experience.

---

## 4. Basic Styling: Global CSS
- By default, Next.js includes a global CSS file: `styles/globals.css`.
- You can import it in `pages/_app.tsx`:

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import '../styles/globals.css';
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

---

## 5. Activity: Customize Your Pages
- Edit your homepage and about page to include your name, a profile picture, or your favorite colors.
- Try adding a new page (e.g., `pages/projects.tsx`) to list your projects.

---

## 6. Summary
- You created and typed your first pages in Next.js
- Learned about file-based routing and global CSS
- Your portfolio app is now live with multiple pages!

## Questions & Tasks

1. **How do you create a typed Next.js page? List the steps and file naming conventions.**  
2. **Why must you use `.tsx` for Next.js pages when using TypeScript?**  
3. **Explain how and where to apply global CSS vs. component-level styles.**  

**Task:**  
```tsx
// Create a new page at pages/projects.tsx
// 1. Export a React.FC component that displays an array of project names.
// 2. Use TypeScript types/interfaces for props if needed.
// 3. Run `npm run dev` and verify `/projects` renders correctly.
```
