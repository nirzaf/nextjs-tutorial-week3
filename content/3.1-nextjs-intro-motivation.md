# 3.1 What is Next.js? Motivation & Use Cases

---

## Learning Objectives
- Understand why Next.js is popular for modern web development
- Compare Client-Side Rendering (CSR) vs Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Identify real-world use cases for Next.js

---

## 1. Introduction to Next.js

**Next.js** is a powerful React framework that enables you to build fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. It adds features like server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and more, all with minimal configuration.

### Why use Next.js?
- **Performance**: Faster page loads with SSR/SSG
- **SEO**: Pages are indexed better by search engines
- **Developer Experience**: Simple setup, hot reloading, and built-in routing
- **Fullstack Capabilities**: Build both frontend and backend (API routes) in one codebase

## 2. Rendering Strategies: CSR vs SSR vs SSG

| Rendering Type | Where Rendered? | When Rendered? | Example Use Case |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| CSR (Client-Side Rendering) | Browser | On every visit | Dashboards, SPAs |
| SSR (Server-Side Rendering) | Server  | On every request | Blogs, News Sites |
| SSG (Static Site Generation) | Build time | Pre-built | Marketing, Docs |

### Visual Diagram
```
[User] ⇄ [Server (SSR/SSG)] ⇄ [Browser (CSR)]
```

- **CSR**: React app loads in the browser, fetches data after initial load
- **SSR**: Server renders HTML for each request, then hydrates with React
- **SSG**: Static HTML generated at build time, served instantly

## 3. When Should You Use Next.js?
- You want fast, SEO-friendly pages
- You need both frontend and backend logic in one place
- You want to use React but need more than just client-side rendering

**Real-World Examples:**
- E-commerce stores (fast product pages, SEO)
- Blogs and documentation sites
- Company websites and portfolios
- SaaS dashboards with authentication

---

## 4. Project Activity: Start Your Portfolio!

> **Goal:** Think about what you want to showcase in your portfolio (projects, skills, contact info). Sketch a simple layout on paper or a tool like Figma.

- What sections will your portfolio have?
- What information do you want to highlight?

In the next session, you will learn about the features of Next.js that will help you bring your portfolio to life!

## 5. Summary
- Next.js is a React framework for building modern web apps
- It supports CSR, SSR, and SSG for flexible rendering
- Ideal for SEO, performance, and fullstack development

## 6. Questions & Tasks

1. **What are the differences between CSR, SSR, and SSG in Next.js? Provide one use case for each.**  
2. **How does Next.js improve SEO compared to a standard React SPA?**  
3. **List three real-world scenarios where Next.js fullstack capabilities shine.**  

**Task:**  
```tsx
// Initialize a new Next.js TypeScript project and create an `about` page:
// 1. CLI: npx create-next-app@latest my-portfolio --typescript
// 2. Create file: pages/about.tsx
import { GetStaticProps, NextPage } from 'next';

interface AboutProps { description: string; }

const About: NextPage<AboutProps> = ({ description }) => <p>{description}</p>;

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<AboutProps> = async () => ({ props: { description: 'Welcome to my portfolio!' } });

export default About;
```
