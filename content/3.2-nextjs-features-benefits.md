# 3.2 Key Features & Benefits of Next.js

---

## Learning Objectives
- Identify the core features that make Next.js powerful
- Understand SSR, SSG, and automatic code splitting
- Get introduced to API routes and developer experience benefits
- See how these features help you build your Student Project Portfolio

---

## 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- **What is SSR?**
  - Pages are rendered on the server for each request, then sent to the client.
  - Great for SEO and initial load performance.
- **How Next.js makes SSR easy:**
  - Just export an `async function getServerSideProps()` in your page component.
- **Example Use Case:**
  - Your portfolio homepage fetches and displays your latest projects from a database, always showing up-to-date info.

---

## 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)
- **What is SSG?**
  - Pages are pre-rendered at build time (not on every request).
  - Super fast, ideal for content that doesn’t change often (e.g., About page).
- **How Next.js makes SSG easy:**
  - Export `async function getStaticProps()` (and optionally `getStaticPaths()` for dynamic routes).
- **Example Use Case:**
  - Your portfolio’s About page or static project details.

---

## 3. Automatic Code Splitting
- **What is it?**
  - Only the code needed for the current page is loaded, making your app fast.
- **How Next.js helps:**
  - Each page in the `pages` directory is automatically code-split.
- **Benefit:**
  - Faster load times for your users.

---

## 4. API Routes (Intro)
- **What are API routes?**
  - Build backend endpoints (like `/api/projects`) right inside your Next.js app.
  - No need for a separate backend server for simple APIs.
- **Example Use Case:**
  - Add a contact form to your portfolio that sends emails using an API route.

---

## 5. Developer Experience (DX) Benefits
- **Fast Refresh:** See code changes instantly in the browser.
- **Zero Config:** Sensible defaults, but highly configurable.
- **Built-in Routing:** File-based routing—just add a file to `pages/`.
- **TypeScript Support:** First-class TypeScript integration.

---

## 6. Rendering Strategies in Next.js
- **`getStaticProps`**: For SSG
- **`getServerSideProps`**: For SSR
- **Client-side Fetching**: For highly dynamic data (e.g., user dashboards)

| Method                | When Runs         | Use Case                  |
|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| `getStaticProps`      | At build time     | Static content, fast load |
| `getServerSideProps`  | On each request   | Always up-to-date data    |
| Client-side Fetching  | In the browser    | User-specific data        |

---

## 7. Activity: Explore Next.js Features
- Visit the [Next.js Examples Gallery](https://nextjs.org/examples) and find a project similar to your portfolio idea.
- List 2–3 features you’d like to use in your own project (e.g., SSR for homepage, SSG for About, API route for contact form).

---

## 8. Summary
- Next.js offers SSR, SSG, API routes, and automatic code splitting out of the box
- These features help you build fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly apps
- Next, you’ll set up your own Next.js project with TypeScript!

## 9. Questions & Tasks

1. **Explain how automatic code splitting works in Next.js and why it’s beneficial.**  
2. **Compare `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`: when would you choose each?**  
3. **List three Developer Experience features in Next.js and how they improve development.**  

**Task:**  
```tsx
// pages/api/hello.ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello Next.js' });
}

// pages/index.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const Home = () => {
  const [msg, setMsg] = useState<string>('');
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/hello')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setMsg(data.message))
      .catch(console.error);
  }, []);

  return <div>{msg || 'Loading...'}</div>;
};

export default Home;
```
